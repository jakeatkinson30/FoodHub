# Food Hub app created using React

## Tech stack used

- HTML
- CSS/SCSS

## Functionality 

As I build out this application, I intend to add a variety of functionality for the user. This will include: a list of delicious recipes with keyword options to click; a clean and easy-to-navigate list of recipes with nice visuals; option to click the recipe for more info and instructions; ability to search through the list of recipes; personalisation options such as colour scheme, font-size and light vs dark mode.

The app will include an emphasis of responsive web design utlising the strengths of SCSS.
